# Operator in JavaScript
>An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

Let's explore the operators in JS:

Assignment: (=) as in a=1;  
Math: (+, -, *, /) as in a+3;   
Compound assignment: (+=, -=, *=, /=)	as in a+=2; same as a= a+2;  
Increment/decrement: (++,--) a++ is same as a=a+1;  
Comparison: (<, >, <=, >=) as in a<=b;  
Logical: (&&, ||) as in a||b, selects either a or b.  
Equity: (==, ===)  
Loose-equal (==): Comparing only value.  
Strict-equal (===): Comparing both value and type.
