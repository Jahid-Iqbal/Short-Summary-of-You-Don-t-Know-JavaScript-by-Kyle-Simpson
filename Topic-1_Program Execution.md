# Program Execution
Computer cannot understand the language what we write. So there is some procedures happening in between the human writing language and machine readable language. In program execution section we will discuss on the intermediate state what are used to translating the codes in machine readable language.

**Two types of translators are available:**
**Interpreter:** 
An interpreter translating the codes line by line each time executing/ running the program.

**Compiler:** 
Compiler transforming the code into machine readable language at once. Creating a copy while translating each time. So, doesn’t need to execute the same code multiple time. Starting translation afterwards for next time.

**Is JavaScript is an interpreted language?**
JavaScript processed the codes every time of execution. That’s why it’s asserted, JavaScript is an interpreted language but actually not. The strong and powerful “V8” engine of JavaScript compiles the code on the fly and then run the code.
